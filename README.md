# Ovation Travel Group - Debit Memo site
The purpose of this site is to display, edit, update and close debit memo's issued by an airline carrier in a streamlined manner.

## The Motivation
Currently, all ADM's are handled via several spreadsheets, manually added, updated and closed. This site will condense data into one application and allow users to log in, make updates, add notes, filter and search. While also logging user interactions with time stamps, increasing accountability.
